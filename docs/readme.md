# Overview

In enterprize settings, it's common for infrastructure provisioning to be managed by a central IT organization. This is often done to ensure that the infrastructure is managed in a consistent and secure manner. However, this can lead to a bottleneck when developers need to provision infrastructure for their applications. [Azure Deployment Environments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/deployment-environments/) is a service that allows IT to define a catalog of infrastructure templates that developers can use to provision infrastructure for their applications. This allows IT to maintain control over the infrastructure, while allowing developers to self-service their infrastructure needs. The Dev Center provider surfaces this capability in internal developer platforms that are built using the [developer platform foundation](https://github.com/microsoft/developer-platform).

This section assumes you have a working knowledge of [Azure Deployment Environments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/deployment-environments/), and its [key concepts](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/deployment-environments/concept-environments-key-concepts) including:

- setting up and workign with a [Dev Center](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/deployment-environments/quickstart-create-and-configure-devcenter)
- [Dev Center projects](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/deployment-environments/quickstart-create-and-configure-projects)
- [Catalogs & Environment definitions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/deployment-environments/concept-environments-key-concepts#catalogs)

> :tip: If you are using the [Azure Developer CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/overview), there is an [azd template](https://azure.github.io/awesome-azd/?name=azure+deployment+environments) that will help you quickly create the necessary resources to use Azure Deployment Environments.
